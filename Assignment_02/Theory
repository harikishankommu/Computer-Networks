Computer Networks Lab Assignment 2

Objective: To understand and implement the functionality of Application Layer protocols — HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS — using Python programming.

------------------------------
1. HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
------------------------------

What is HTTP?
- HTTP is the protocol used for transferring data between a web browser (client) and a web server.
- Whenever you open a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the web page data (HTML, CSS, images, etc.).

Uses:
1. Fetching and displaying web pages.
2. Communicating between clients and servers over the web.

Example:
- When you type http://example.com in a browser, your browser uses HTTP to fetch and display the webpage.

Workflow:
Connect → Send GET/POST → Receive Response → Log → Done

------------------------------
2. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
------------------------------

What is SMTP?
- SMTP is used to send emails from your computer (email client) to an email server.
- It is also used for transferring emails between mail servers until they reach the recipient’s server.

Uses:
1. Sending emails to other users.
2. Delivering emails between mail servers.

Example:
- When you send an email in Gmail, your email goes out using SMTP to reach the recipient’s mail server.

In short:
SMTP = Sending emails
POP3 / IMAP = Reading or receiving emails

Workflow:
Connect → Start TLS → Login → Send Email → Quit

------------------------------
3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
------------------------------
What is FTP?
- FTP is a network protocol used to transfer files between a client (your computer) and a server (remote machine).
- Works like a shared folder over the internet where you can:
   1. Upload files (client → server)
   2. Download files (server → client)
   3. List or manage files on the server

How it Works:
1. The client connects to the FTP server (default port 21).
2. User logs in (username & password or anonymously).
3. Files are transferred (upload, download, delete, rename).
4. Connection closes when done.

Workflow:
Connect → Login → Upload → Download → Verify → List Directory → Quit

------------------------------
4. DNS (Domain Name System)
------------------------------

What is DNS?
- DNS is like the phonebook of the internet.
- Converts human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (142.250.190.14) that computers understand.
- Helps you find websites, email servers, and other services.

How it Works:
1. You provide a domain name.
2. DNS servers return the IP address or other records (A, MX, CNAME).
3. Your computer connects to the server using that IP.

Workflow:
Input Domain → Query A/MX/CNAME → Log Results → Done

Summary Table of Workflows
------------------------------

| Protocol | Workflow |
|----------|---------|
| HTTP     | Connect → Send GET/POST → Receive Response → Log → Done |
| SMTP     | Connect → Start TLS → Login → Send Email → Quit |
| FTP      | Connect → Login → Upload → Download → Verify → List Directory → Quit |
| DNS      | Input Domain → Query A/MX/CNAME → Log Results → Done |
